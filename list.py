# What is a List?
# A list is an ordered, mutable (changeable) collection of items.
# Can store mixed data types (int, str, float, etc.).
# Written inside square brackets [ ]
# my_list = [1, 2, 3, "hello", 4.5]
# print(my_list)  
# Output: [1, 2, 3, 'hello', 4.5]


# empty_list = []
# number = [1,2,3,4,5]



# Accesing elements
# Indexing starts at 0
# Negative index --> counts from end
# nums = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
# print(nums[0])   # 10
# print(nums[-1])  # 50


# slicing
# nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
# print(nums[1:4])   # [2, 3, 4]
# print(nums[:3])    # [1, 2, 3]
# print(nums[::2])   # [1, 3, 5]  (step of 2)

# a = ["Python","HTML", "Css"]
# a[-1]="Python"
# print(a)


# sum of all numbers

# a = [12,3,43,43,23,43]
# b = sum(a)
# print(b)


# tuples i python ??
# What is a Tuple?
# A tuple is an ordered collection like a list.
# Immutable â†’ you cannot change, add, or remove elements once created.
# Defined using parentheses ( )

# a = ("krish","gour")
# a[-1]="krish"
# print(a)


# a = (1,1,2,3,4,5,6,7)
# print(a.count(1)) with the help of count in tuple you can count the numbers how many times the value print


# a = (1,2,3,4,4,5)
# print(a.index(5)) index is used to know find the indexing value
